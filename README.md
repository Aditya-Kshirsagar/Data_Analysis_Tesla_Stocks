# Data_Analysis_Tesla_Stocks
This project is all about cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.

# Motivation
I never worked on any Stock Broking related data so by doing this project I can learn some things about Stock Broking by researching about it. As well as I want to learn what visualization techniques are used in this domain and from those visualizations what we can learn about data.
