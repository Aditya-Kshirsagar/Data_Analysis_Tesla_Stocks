# Data_Analysis_Tesla_Stocks
This project is all about cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.

# Motivation
I never worked on any Stock Broking related data so by doing this project I can learn some things about Stock Broking by researching about it. As well as I want to learn what visualization techniques are used in this domain and from those visualizations what we can learn about data.

## Conclusion
From above graph we can state that initially company stocks price was increasing steadily but after end of the 1st quater. profit start increasing exponentially.

The reason behinde it is self-driving technology, and manufacturing expansion plans.

Tesla published a document on April 2 stating that it had produced almost 103,000 vehicles and delivered roughly 88,400 vehicles in the first quarter record performance on both fronts for the period. The stock climbed in conjunction with momentum for the broader market early in the month, and it saw more pronounced positive movement after Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois upgraded his rating on the stock from "hold" to "buy" in a note published on April 6.
